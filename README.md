## Installing tbai

To instal `tbai_ros`, we recommend using `pixi`, though `tbai_ros` is a full-fledged ROS package and it can be integrated into your projects in using conventional tools and methods. We use `pixi` for reproducibility.

```bash
# Install pixi
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh # You might have to source your config again

# Install tbai_ros
mkdir -p ros/src && cd ros/src && git clone git@github.com:lnotspotl/tbai_ros.git --recursive && cd tbai_ros && ./tbai_ros.bash --fresh_install
```

Once the installation is complete, you can run one of our many examples, for instance:

```bash
# Activate pixi environment
pixi shell --environment all

# Run NP3O example
source $(catkin locate)/devel/setup.bash && roslaunch tbai_ros_np3o simple_go2.launch gui:=true
```
