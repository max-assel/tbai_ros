## Installing tbai

To install `tbai_ros`, we recommend using `pixi`, though `tbai_ros` is a full-fledged ROS package and it can be integrated into your projects in using conventional tools and methods. We use `pixi` for reproducibility. Don't worry that ROS is past its end of life, pixi (or micromamba) will install everything for you (even on the newest Ubuntu release) 😮

### Alternative 1: pixi
```bash
# Install pixi
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh # You might have to source your config again

# Install tbai_ros
mkdir -p ros/src && cd ros/src
git clone https://github.com/max-assel/tbai_ros.git --recursive && cd tbai_ros
pixi install && pixi shell --environment all-gpu-free
just fresh-install-all-gpu-free
```

### Alternative 2: micromamba
```bash
# Install micromamba
"${SHELL}" <(curl -L micro.mamba.pm/install.sh) # You might have to source your config again

# Clone tbai_ros
mkdir -p ros/src && cd ros/src
git clone https://github.com/max-assel/tbai_ros.git --recursive && cd tbai_ros

# Create conda environment
micromamba env create -f .conda/all-gpu-free.yaml
micromamba activate all-gpu-free

# Install tbai_ros
just fresh-install-all-gpu-free
```

Once the installation is complete, you can run one of our many examples, for instance:

```bash
# Activate pixi environment
pixi shell --environment all-gpu-free

# Run NP3O example
source $(catkin locate)/devel/setup.bash && roslaunch tbai_ros_np3o simple_go2.launch gui:=true

# Run MPC example
source $(catkin locate)/devel/setup.bash && roslaunch tbai_ros_mpc anymal_d_perceptive.launch gui:=true

# Run BOB example
source $(catkin locate)/devel/setup.bash && roslaunch tbai_ros_bob anymal_d_perceptive.launch gui:=true

# Run DTC example
source $(catkin locate)/devel/setup.bash && roslaunch tbai_ros_dtc simple.launch gui:=true

# Try out other examples located under tbai_ros_mpc, tbai_ros_bob, tbai_ros_dtc, tbai_ros_joe and tbai_ros_np3o
```
